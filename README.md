# US Census Data

Navigate to my website for the project using [this link](https://epiq-challenge.herokuapp.com/).

You can filter data according to:
- a city name that you input or
- the state which you can select via dropdown menu or 
- setting the minimum population size or 
- setting the maximum population size

You can also sort the data by clicking on the heading of each table (City, State, Population) to sort by the category you select.

## Future fixes:
- Configure Javascript to allow filtering by all methods at the same time
- Flesh out design, layout and CSS
- Reduce load times
